# Project Progress: Mira AI Agent

## Current Status
- **Overall Progress**: 25%
- **Current Phase**: Phase 8: Full Feature Implementation
- **The application is successfully deployed and live on Render's native Python runtime.**
- Unit tests are in place and passing for all implemented functionality.
- **Placeholder for "Market Trend Analysis" feature is implemented and tested.**
- **Placeholder for "Wallet Activity Monitoring" feature is implemented and tested.**
- **Placeholder for "New Listing Alerts" feature is implemented and tested.**
- The scheduler for checking price alerts is implemented and tested.
- The price alert setting feature is implemented and integrated.
- Database models and manager for users and price alerts are implemented.
- The project summary generation feature is implemented and integrated.
- A robust service layer for interacting with the UnleashNFTs API has been implemented.
- The bot is integrated with the NLU processor to classify user intent.
- The bot connects to Telegram and responds to a `/start` command.
- The core Memory Bank documents have been initialized.
- The initial `README.md` has been created.
- The project directory structure has been created.

## What Works

## What's Left to Build
- The majority of the core application logic and user-facing features still need to be implemented.
- The current features are placeholders and need to be connected to real data (e.g., resolving collection names to addresses).

## Known Issues
- The initial deployment was challenging. The original Docker-based approach with a Gunicorn server was incompatible with the `python-telegram-bot` library, leading to a series of `AttributeError` and `RuntimeError` issues.
- **Resolution**: The project was refactored to use a native Python runtime on Render. The Docker dependency was removed, and the application now runs using the bot library's built-in webhook server. This has proven to be a stable and successful deployment strategy.
