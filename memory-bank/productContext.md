# Product Context: Mira AI Agent

## 1. Problem Space
The NFT market is volatile and information is fragmented across various platforms like Twitter, Discord, and analytics dashboards. This makes it difficult for users to:
- React quickly to market changes (e.g., floor price drops).
- Discover new opportunities (e.g., new listings in a desired collection).
- Perform due diligence on new projects without extensive manual research.

## 2. Product Vision
Mira aims to be the go-to AI assistant for the Web3 community, starting with NFTs. It will act as a smart, proactive agent that lives where the users areâ€”on Telegram. By understanding natural language, Mira removes the friction of complex interfaces and delivers actionable insights directly to the user.

## 3. User Experience Goals
- **Conversational**: Interactions should feel like talking to a knowledgeable assistant, not using a rigid command-line tool.
- **Actionable**: The information provided by Mira should empower users to make timely and informed decisions.
- **Trustworthy**: Data must be accurate and sourced reliably from the BitCrunch API.
- **Effortless**: Setting up alerts and getting information should be simple and require minimal steps.
