## Current Focus
- **Phase 7: New Feature Implementation (Placeholders)**
- **Current Task**: Implement placeholder functionality for the new features outlined in `new_features_plan.md`. The first feature, "New Listing Alerts," has been implemented as a placeholder.

## Next Steps
1.  Implement the "Wallet Activity Monitoring" feature as a placeholder.
2.  Implement the "Market Trend Analysis" feature as a placeholder.
3.  Once all placeholders are in, begin full implementation of the features.

## Active Decisions
- **Deployment Strategy**: The project has officially moved away from a Docker-based deployment. The new standard is a native Python runtime on Render, managed by a `render.yaml` file. This decision was made after significant deployment challenges with the Docker/Gunicorn approach.
- **Scheduler**: The scheduler is implemented via a webhook called by an external cron service, due to the limitations of Render's free tier.
- **API Integration**: The UnleashNFTs API integration has been corrected to use the proper authentication headers, integer chain IDs, and required query parameters.
