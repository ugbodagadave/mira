# Active Context: Mira AI Agent

## Current Focus
- **Phase 7: New Feature Implementation (Placeholders)**
- **Current Task**: All placeholder functionalities for the new features outlined in `new_features_plan.md` have been implemented.

## Next Steps
1.  Begin full implementation of the "New Listing Alerts" feature.
2.  Begin full implementation of the "Wallet Activity Monitoring" feature.
3.  Begin full implementation of the "Market Trend Analysis" feature.

## Active Decisions
- **Deployment Strategy**: The project has officially moved away from a Docker-based deployment. The new standard is a native Python runtime on Render, managed by a `render.yaml` file. This decision was made after significant deployment challenges with the Docker/Gunicorn approach.
- **Scheduler**: The scheduler is implemented via a webhook called by an external cron service, due to the limitations of Render's free tier.
- **API Integration**: The UnleashNFTs API integration has been corrected to use the proper authentication headers, integer chain IDs, and required query parameters.
