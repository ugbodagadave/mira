# Active Context: Mira AI Agent

## Current Focus
- **Phase 6: Awaiting Next Feature Development**
- **Current Task**: The bot is now stable and deployed. All documentation has been updated to reflect the successful native Python deployment on Render.

## Next Steps
1.  Plan the next feature implementation (e.g., full implementation of price alerts, wallet tracking).
2.  Begin development on the next feature.

## Active Decisions
- **Deployment Strategy**: The project has officially moved away from a Docker-based deployment. The new standard is a native Python runtime on Render, managed by a `render.yaml` file. This decision was made after significant deployment challenges with the Docker/Gunicorn approach.
- **Scheduler**: The scheduler is implemented via a webhook called by an external cron service, due to the limitations of Render's free tier.
- **API Integration**: The UnleashNFTs API integration has been corrected to use the proper authentication headers, integer chain IDs, and required query parameters.
